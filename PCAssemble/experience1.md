# PC Assembly Project

## Assembly Process

The assembly of the PC involved several key steps:

0Ô∏è‚É£ **Clip the CPU properly onto the motherboard** before proceeding with the other components.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Place the ‚ùÑÔ∏è CPU fan onto the üß† CPU** and secure it with screws using a screwdriver.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Install the hard disk**, ensuring it's positioned correctly.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Insert the RAM into the motherboard's slot**, ensuring it's aligned properly, and press down firmly until a "click" sound confirms it's securely in place.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Install the power supply unit** by screwing it into position.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Connect all necessary cables** to the motherboard, hard disk, and power supply unit.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Close the case** after ensuring all components are connected.

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Connect the PC to a monitor** and power it on to verify the system works.

Once the monitor powered up successfully, we knew our assembly was complete. üéâ

## Individual Reflection

This project was an excellent learning opportunity for me. As an individual, I focused on ensuring that each component was securely placed and connected correctly. I learned the importance of patience, attention to detail, and the proper handling of sensitive computer parts, like the CPU and RAM. The experience allowed me to improve my problem-solving skills when troubleshooting any issues during the assembly process.

During the project, I also gained a deeper understanding of how all the parts of a computer work together, which has strengthened my knowledge in computer hardware. The teamwork aspect of the project was incredibly rewarding as well. Working together with the group allowed us to share knowledge and finish the task quickly. It was fulfilling to be part of the team that completed the assembly process first!

I also learned about time management and the need to coordinate tasks effectively with teammates. We had to balance our individual contributions to make sure we stayed on track. Overall, the project was a great success and a valuable experience for me.
