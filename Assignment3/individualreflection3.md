# Individual Reflection - Industrial Talk on 17th December 2024

## ðŸ’¡ **Reflection**

After attending this insightful session, I now have a clearer understanding of the **skills required in the IT industry**. Both **technical skills**, such as **programming** and **version control**, and **management skills**, such as **problem-solving** and **leadership**, are essential to succeed in the field.

The emphasis on **self-exploration** and securing **internships** resonated with me, reminding me of the importance of **gaining hands-on experience** early in my career. The **IRPA method** for job applications provided me with a structured approach to prepare for my job search in the future.

I also realized the importance of **continuous learning** and developing both **hard** and **soft skills**. The talk was a great opportunity to understand what industry leaders are looking for and how I can prepare myself for success. Moving forward, I plan to focus on strengthening my technical skills, particularly in programming, and gain **real-world experience** through internships to increase my chances of success in the IT field.
